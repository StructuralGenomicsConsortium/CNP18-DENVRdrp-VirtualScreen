# CNP18-DENVRdrp-VirtualScreen

An [SGC](https://www.thesgc.org/) Open Chemical Networks Project (number 18) devoted to the dengue virus (DENV) RdRp, focusing specifically on exploring the the enamine library and virtual screening of this library against a site on the protein.

## General information

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If this sounds interesting, and you agree to the simple [RULES](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/terms-of-use), you can get started.


For answers to all the questions you have, go to the [FAQs](https://www.thesgc.org/sgc-open-chemistry-networks/faq).

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the ["How To" Area](https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/Chemistry_TechOps_HowTo/wiki)
